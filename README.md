PSC - The Proto SCEL Compiler
=============================

This is a simple compiler of a vaguely SCEL-like language to bytecode.
Its main goal is to help me understand how SCEL is supposed to work.

The instruction set of the virtual machine resembles the one in
Norvig's Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case
Studies in Common Lisp.  For now you'll have to look there for a
description of the opcodes.
